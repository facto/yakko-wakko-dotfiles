# High-Level Overview

Yakko Wakko Dotfiles (YWD) is an ***opinionated*** set of dotfiles carefully put together with a few things in mind.

* **Terminal, Terminal, Terminal**
    * Designed from scratch and highly optimized for the terminal. Stay where you play.
* **Lots of plugins + lazy-loading == awesome**
    * Yes, it's possible to have an acceptably speedy development experience with a crap-ton of plugins.
    * YWD is continuously updated with the latest and greatest tools to aid efficiency.
    * We try not to duplicate or break existing functionality unless it makes sense for efficiency and/or RSI-reduction purposes.
* **Sane defaults++**
    * Contains configuration for the following language-agnostic tools:
        * Neovim
        * Tmux
        * ZSH (built on a [prezto](http://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) base)
        * Git
* **Extendable**
    * Want to add your own plugins? Not happy with some of the defaults? It's all easy to change.
* **Supports OS X *and* Linux**
    * OS X
        * Easily install my favorite OS X hacks (**WARNING:** You must understand what all of these are before installing! Check the comments.)
    * Linux
